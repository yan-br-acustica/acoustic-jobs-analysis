Applications are invited for a Research Fellow to be based in the Institute of Sound Recording (IoSR,  [http://iosr.uk](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fiosr.uk%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7C34ad7bfcf0434133508d08da40619de2%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637893085246811897%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=SyP6LpijuF9FriNy6LXhAU8uY3EyYv80Qm%2By3xSrnK4%3D&reserved=0) ) and to work full-time on the EPSRC project SCReAM (“SCalable Room Acoustic Modelling”). The post is available for 24 months, from 1/August_2022 until 31_July_2024. For an exceptional candidate, a later start date may be accommodated, subject to the approval from the funder. You can submit the application up until 26_June/2022, but you are encouraged to do so as soon as possible since interviews may start even before the deadline.

The post-holder will work on exploring connections between room acoustic models; defining new unifying and scalable room acoustic models; adapting those models for application in e.g. consumer electronics, computer games, immersive media, and architectural acoustics. 

The successful applicant will have a range of skills, including some of the following: strong, independent research skills; an excellent signal processing background; knowledge of room acoustic models; expertise/interest in numerical acoustics; enthusiasm for working with project partners at other universities and organisations (including, among others, KU Leuven, Electronic Arts and Sonos). 

The IoSR is home to the Tonmeister degree in Music and Sound Recording, which produced a stream of highly successful graduates (including three Oscar winners, seven Grammy winners, and twelve BAFTA winners), and is a leading centre for research in acoustic engineering. It has several projects funded from research councils and industry, involving human listening tests, acoustic measurement, statistical modelling and digital signal processing. Current work is, for example, developing systems for spatial enhancement of object-based audio reproduction, for timbral perception modelling, and for next-generation environment-aware headphones.
