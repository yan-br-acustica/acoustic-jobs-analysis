# 12 Volocopter acoustic engineer
Company Description

We at Volocopter are pioneers in the development of electrical air taxis that take off and land vertically (eVTOLs). We bring Urban Air Mobility to life, by establishing air taxis in addition to current transportation options in megacities globally. Our aim is to offer affordable on-demand air taxi services and save people time by flying them safely to their destination. In 2011 we performed the first-ever piloted flight of a purely electrical multicopter and have since showcased numerous public flights with our full-scale Volocopter (www.volocopter.com).

Job Description

Your future Volocopter crew:

Our Flight Science Team deals with Aircraft Physics including Flight Mechanics, Performance, Aerodynamics, Rotor and Acoustics. The team currently consists of 4 permanent employees and 2 student interns but will scale up until the end of the year to 10 permanent employees. We are a proud international team with German, Italian, Canadian, Turkish and Indian nationalities.

Your mission during this flight:

You are an experienced (Aero-)acoustics engineer and have demonstrated experience in acoustics analysis of rotorcrafts. You are aware of the requirements for multidisciplinary analysis (aerodynamics, flight mechanics, flight control) and know respective analysis methods. Within a highly motivated multi-disciplinary team you will work closely with aerodynamicists, flight control experts, structural dynamics engineers and analysts to provide acoustic analysis to support the aircraft development and certification process.
* Actively participate in the design of tasks using your technical skills in the field of acoustics
* Work as part of a multi-physics team taking into account various flight physical aspects of the aircraft
* Use various simulation techniques to compute the acoustics of the aircraft
* Support the development of internal noise reduction methods
* Conduct the acoustic optimization of the aircraft design (geometry, procedures, components)
* Define test procedures and interface with experimentalists to ensure high quality data acquisition (e.g. ICAO standards)
* Exchange with authorities on noise certification standards and techniques applicable for VTOLs
* Test data post-processing, data reduction and reporting in terms of compliance document
* Collaborate with external partners within a public funded project

Qualifications

Check in your professional skills:

Required skills
* Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering degree (MSc, Ph.D.)
* At least 4 years of professional experience in the field of aircraft acoustics (preferably of rotorcraft)
