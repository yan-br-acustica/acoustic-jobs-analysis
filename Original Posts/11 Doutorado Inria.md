# 11 Doutorado Inria
Inria is opening a fixed-term research assistant position on private
machine learning for speech processing as part of the French national
collaborative project ANR DEEP-PRIVACY. The successful candidate will be
part of the Magnet team in Lille, which focuses on privacy-friendly,
decentralized and_or graph-based machine learning. He_she will work in
tight collaboration with the Multispeech team in Nancy, which focuses on
automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis.
The goal of DEEP-PRIVACY is to learn automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems from speech representations that hide speaker identity.
Additional requirements such as decentralized learning, gender fairness,
or data efficiency may be considered.
Depending on her/his profile, the candidate will address the following
research questions:
- [ ] how to design privacy attacks on ASR and design counter-measures;
- [ ] how to learn private representations of speech from adversarial
training with many attackers;
- [ ] how to design fair and private speech representations;
- [ ] how to adapt such methods in the decentralized setting (e.g. federated
or fully decentralized learning);
- [ ] how to formally define and measure the trade-off between accuracy,
fairness, or privacy at the global and individual levels.
Application deadline: applications will be assessed on a rolling basis;
please apply as soon as possible.
