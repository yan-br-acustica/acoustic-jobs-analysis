# 8 Doutorado Cerco
We are looking for a PhD candidate to work with us at the Centre de Recherche de Cerveau et Cognition (CerCo) in Toulouse, France. The project will be led by Benedikt Zoefel and funded by the Agence National de Recherche (ANR).
The successful applicant will join a lively research institute in a thriving city in Southern France. The project aims to better understand rhythmic patterns in auditory perception and neural activity, using EEG to test novel hypotheses about the role of neural oscillations for auditory perception and attention.
Applicants should hold a Masterâ€™s degree in neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, hearing science, engineering or similar. They must have experience with programming (MATLAB, Python or similar) and some signal processing skills. Previous experience with EEG, or a background in research on neural oscillations, are not strictly necessary, but  appreciated.
Starting date is flexible (between March and September 2022).
To apply, please send a CV, including the name of two potential references, and a summary of research interests (< 1 page) to Benedikt Zoefel (benedikt.zoefel at cnrs.fr). Review of applications will begin on 4th February and remain ongoing until the position is filled.
