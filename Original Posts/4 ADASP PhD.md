# 4 ADASP PhD
Telecom Paris’ ADASP research group ( [https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr](https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/?fbclid=IwAR12C9isAFWySGp2oiXMri92_myzsXKw0mQ0gUDaNPZCqSgGxA74Kn8-HNM) ) is welcoming applications for multiple PhD student, postdoc and research engineer positions in machine listening, MIR and speech /audio / music DSP to start in September 2022 onwards.
The work will be performed as part of a collaborative project whose purpose is to revolutionise hearable technologies (especially TWS/earbuds) by offering extremely efficient real-time machine listening, speech processing and MIR solutions which can run on very low consumption hardware.
Telecom Paris [2] is located on the Plateau de Saclay (Paris outskirts). Accepted candidates will join the ADASP group [4], a multidisciplinary team working at the intersection of machine learning, sound, music and signal processing.

— Context
Telecom Paris [2] is a French leading engineering school and scientific research institution, founded in July 1878. It is a founding member of the Institut Polytechnique de Paris [1], a world-class scientific and technological institution.
The Information Processing and Communication Laboratory (LTCI) [3] is Telecom Paris’ in-house research laboratory. Since January 2017, it has continued the work previously carried out by the CNRS joint research unit of the same name. The LTCI was created in 1982 and is known for its extensive coverage of topics in the field of information and communication technologies. The LTCI’s core subject areas are computer science, networks, data science, signal and image processing and digital communications. The laboratory is also active in issues related to systems engineering and applied mathematics.
The open position will be hosted by Telecom Paris’ Audio Data Analysis and Signal Processing (ADASP) group [4], a subgroup of the statistics, signal processing and machine learning (S²A) team, within the Images, Data & Signals (IDS) department.
