# 20 Technical project manager GE
Job Description Summary
The Aerodynamics & Acoustics Technical Project manager reports to the Director of Aero & Acoustics, being part of Front-End Engineering (FEE) in LM Engineering & Technology department.
In this role, he/she will drive new aerodynamic and aeroacoustics technology introduction (NTI) and R&D programs, towards their integration onto the next generation of LM Blade products.
This role offers a great opportunity to contribute to deliver reliable, high performance and cost-competitive wind turbines blades to GE and third-party OEMs all over the world.

Job Description

Roles & Responsibilities
* Drive rigorous execution of NTI (New Technology Introduction) and R&D programs regarding on time delivery and resource management.
* Work with cross-functional NTI teams within LM Engineering and Manufacturing departments to develop and enable aero and acoustic technologies NPI ready.
* Develop the aero acoustic technology and ensure aero acoustic design is integral part of new blade product design.
* Drive continuous improvements in managing the aerodynamic data generated from simulations, wind tunnel and field testing and make it easily accessible to FEE team.
* Keeping up to date in new technology developments in the areas of aerodynamics and aero acoustics.

Required Qualifications
* Advanced degree (MSc/PhD) in Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering
* Proven (10+ years) experience in aerodynamics_aeroelasticity_aero-acoustics applied to wind turbines.
* Exposure to testing & validation methods (wind tunnel, field testing).
* Understanding of numerical modelling and simulation tools for wind turbines or other complex industrial applications (turbomachinery, aerospace).
* Capability to drive task execution and rigorously manage technology initiatives, ensuring compliance to existing process as well as pursuing continuous improvement.
* Good communication, open mindset and ability to work effectively with multi-cultural and distributed teams.

Desired Characteristics
* Hands-on experience in CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and/or aero-elastic simulations tools (e.g. Hawc2, Simpack, Flex5, Bladed, etc.)
* Expertise in wind turbine blade geometry design
* Knowledge of coding languages like C, C++, Python, Matlab
* Experience in high and low fidelity aero acoustics modelling and prediction tools.
